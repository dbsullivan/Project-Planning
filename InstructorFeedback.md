### Project Problem Statement and Plan

Dave, your Tennis League application sounds like it will be a lot of fun to build! I like that you chose a topic that you know well. It always makes it easier and more interesting to create something we can use ourselves!  After reading your problem statement and hearing your overview in class a couple times, it's clear that this project should meet the project requirements very nicely. The only piece I did not catch: what will your independent research topic/technology be?

At a high level your schedule looks good, but it could use more detailed tasks, such as

    * UI design
    * Database design 
    * Class design
    * Application flow diagrams
    * Create final presentation
    * Remember that the technologies we are learning in class like Log4J, jUnit, Hibernate, etc. should be included in the plan (these might span multiple weeks).  
    * Also be sure to include tasks for your weekly blog/wiki/status report.


Looking forward to seeing your progress through the semester; this will be a fun one!
